The issue with fetching total commits might be due to a temporary problem with the GitHub API or the GitHub Stats service you're using. Sometimes these services face rate limits or temporary outages. Here are a few alternatives to address this:

### 1. Use an Alternative GitHub Stats Service
You can switch to another service or modify the code to try and fetch your GitHub stats. For example, use `GitHub Readme Stats` but from a different hosted instance:

```md
![Surafel's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats-ruby-one.vercel.app/api?username=SurafelK&show_icons=true&theme=city_light&hide_border=false&count_private=true)
```

You can also deploy your own instance of `github-readme-stats` on Vercel by following [this guide](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats).

### 2. Remove the Total Commits Information
You can also remove the part that displays the total commits if it continues to cause issues. Here’s the updated version without that:
